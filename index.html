    <h1> 

        Do you know your partner enough?  

    </h1> 

     

    <p> 

        If you think you do, then you don't. You really still think that you do, then by all means it  

        is a healthy place to be with someone you share your love, time, and energy with.  

        Today everyone wants to be loved correctly, everyone wants loyalty, but the majority  

        do not reciprocate and give the same thing back in return.  

        And what I am about to say to you are only two concrete ways to know what your partner thinks about you.  

        Some people will tell you spend time to know a person, that is straight bull! Some people are so good at  

        pretending you will never see the disguise. But that is not the point, most of the time you discover 

        someone's true intentions or personality it is too late.  

    </p> 

 
 
 
 

    <h2> 

        Two ways to really know what your partner thinks about you: 

    </h2> 

 
 

    <p> 

 
 

        <ul> 

            <li>Tap into the conversations they have with their best friends about you! </li> 

            <li>No matter how well you know your partner, they are totally different people on that phone. </li> 

        </ul> 

 
 

    </p> 

 
 
 

    <p> 

        And I know what you are thinking, you don't want to be toxic. You don't want to invade their privacy. 

        Sounds illegal but there are only two ways. 

    </p> 

 
 

    <h2> 

        The Conversation 

    </h2> 

    <p> 

        I always tell people. It matters more to me when you defend my name behind my back, rather than be nice 

        to my face then the complete opposite to in my absence.  

        My girlfriend and I was in an argument and told her best friend. On that same day  

        she saw her Ex and texted her best friend " I feel like kissing him (making reference to the Ex)" 

        The best friend's advice was " Yea girl do it, if you feel like your man ain't cutting it" 

        But let me tell you that that same best friend was already trying to get with me. This I told  

        my girlfriend and while she was aware she kept the friendship with her "best-friend." 

 
 

        I shared this story to ask, "Does Your partner's best friend know things you don't"  

    </p> 

    <p> 

        Your partner's best friend(s) is the only person(s) who knows how they are really feeling about you.  

        Check it, whether your partner is a male or female. Most of the time they need a second to back up  

        their story who do they call?? You already know, the best friend. Let me trickle down the "best friend"  

        term for you. There are friends who will know you have a good woman or a good man in your life and  

        try to hint you to do "hoe" like things. Things that they know will jeopardize your relationship if your 

        partner finds out. SO now what happens is that they have your secrets, and they make you feel  

        like you can trust them. But really you are digging yourself into a hole. So now you feel like you can  

        trust them and you vent to them about everything that goes on in your relationship. They know when you  

        cheat, if you cheated, when, with whom, how, and all the details you can imagine. It is for this reason 

        If you really want to know how your partner feels about you, tap into the conversations they have with  

        their best friends especially when you have a fight.  

    </p> 

 
 
 

    <h2>   

        The Phone 

    </h2> 

    <P> 

        This can be a very stigmatic topic.  

        I would never tell you that searching your partner's phone is the healthiest thing to do. It is not! 

        It is your choice, but it is better if you know what is really going on than to end up wasting  

        your time with somebody that is playing you.  

        I will throw a couple of questions out there and if you can relate then reevaluate your relationship! 

 
 

        <ul> 

            <li>Your partner's "EX" still texts his/her phone? </li> 

            <li>Your partner Is very secretive with their phone? </li> 

            <li>Text messages are always incomplete and seem deleted? </li> 

        </ul> 

    </P> 

 
 

    <p> 

                If you are in a healthy relationship, you should have access to your partner's phone without  

        question. You are both making a life together, investing time, energy, and effort into each other there 

        should be nothing to hide. Why would you want privacy outside of your relationship? That sounds like a  

        different life outside of the relationship. DO you know what happens in a tag of war? The 

        rope goes back and forth until one instance the more unstable/weaker side falls.  

        DO not compete with your love and break your own heart. Value yourself, do not short sell yourself 

        no matter how much you think you love a person. You must have strength in thinking with  

        your brain and your heart. Emotions clouds judgement, and it is after all is being said and done you realize  

        you deserved better.
