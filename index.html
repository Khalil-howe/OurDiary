        Do you know your partner enough? 
    </h1>
    
    <p>
        If you think you do, then you dont. You you really still think that you do, then by all means it 
        is definitely a healthy place to be with someone you share our love, time and energy with. 
        In today's society everyone wants to be loved correctly, everyone wants loyalty, but majority 
        do not reciprocate and give the same thing back in return. 
        And what I am about to say to you are only two concrete way to know what your partner thinks about you. 
        SOme people will tell you spend time to know a perosn, that is straight bull! Some people are so good at 
        pretending you will never see the discise. But that is not the point, most of the times you discover
        someones true intentions or perosnality it is too late. 
    </p>



    <h2>
        Two ways to really know what your partner thinks about you:
    </h2>

    <p>

        <ul>
            <li>Tap into the conversations they have with their best friends about you!</li>
            <li>No matter how well you know your partner, they are a totally different person in that phone. </li>
        </ul>

    </p>


    <p>
        And I knwo what you are thinking, you dont want to be toxic. You dont want to invade their privacy.
        Sounds illegal but these are only two ways.
    </p>

    <h2>
        The Conversation
    </h2>
    <p>
        I always tell people. It matters more to me when you defend my name behind my back, rather than be nice
        to my face then the complete opposite to in my absence. 
        My girlfriend and I was in an argument and told her bestfriend. On that same day 
        she saw her Ex and texted her best friend " I feel like kissing him(making reference to the Ex)"
        The best friend's advice was " Yhea girl do it, if you feel like your man ain't cutting it"
        But let me tell you that that same best friend was already trying to get with me. This I told 
        my girlfriend and while she was awareshe kept the friendship with her "best-friend."

        I shared this story to ask, "Does Your partner's best friend know things you dont" 
    </p>
    <p>
        Your partner's best friend(s) is the only person(s) who knows how they are really feeling about you. 
        Check it, whether your partner is a male or female. MOst of the times they need a second to bakc up 
        their story who do they call?? You already know, the best friend. Let me trickle down the "best friend" 
        term for you. Their are friends who will knwo you have a good woman or a good man in your life and 
        try to hint you to do "hoe" like things. Thinsg that they know will jeperdise your realtionship if your
        partner finds out. SO now what happens is that they have your secrets and they make you feel 
        like you can trust them. But really you are digging yourself into a hole. So now you feel like you can 
        trust them and you vent to them about everyhting that goes on in your relationship. They know when you 
        cheat, if you cheated, when, with whom, how, and all the details you cna imagine. It is for ths reason
        if you really want to know how your partner feels about you, tap into the conversations they have with 
        their best friends especially when you have a fight.

    <h2>  
        The Phone
    </h2>
    <P>
        This can be a very stigmatic topic. 
        I would never tell you that searchign your partners phone is the healtiest thinsg to do. It is not!
        It is your choice, but in my opinion it is better you know whats really going on than to end up wasting 
        your time with somebody that is playing you. 
        I will throw a couple of questions out there and if you can relate then reevaluate your relationship!

        <ul>
            <li>Your partner's "EX" still text his/her phone? </li>
            <li>Your partner i s very secretive with their phone? </li>
            <li>Text messages are always sketchy and seems deleted? </li>
        </ul>
    </P>

    <p>
                If you are in a healthy relationship, you should have access to your partner's phone without 
        question. You are both making a life together, investing time, energy and effort into each other there
        should be nothing to hide. WHy would you want privacy outside of your relatioship? That sounds like a 
        different life outside of the relationship. DO you knwo what happens in a tag of war? The
        rope goes back and forth until one instance the more unstable/weaker side falls. 
        DO not compete with your love, and break your own heart. Value yourself, do not short sell yourself
        no matter how much you think you love a person. You have to have strength in thinking with 
        your brain and your heart. Emotions clouds judgement, and it is after all is being said and done you realize 
        you deserved better.
